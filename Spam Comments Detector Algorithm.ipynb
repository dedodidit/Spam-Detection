    "### Problem\n",
    "Spam Comments Detection; Spam refers to unsolicited, unwanted, or irrelevant messages that are sent in bulk through electronic messaging systems such as email, text messages, or social media. Spam is usually sent for commercial purposes, such as advertising products or services, but it can also be sent for malicious purposes, such as phishing scams or spreading malware.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spam is generally considered a nuisance and can be harmful as it can consume network resources, slow down systems, and expose users to various forms of fraud or security risks. Many email providers and social media platforms use various techniques to filter out and block spam messages, such as spam filters, blacklists, or captcha tests. Definitely not something we want around"
